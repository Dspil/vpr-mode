[[https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html][Viper]] language support for Emacs.

** Installation

This package is under heavy development and does not support all Viper features. Thus, it is not published in any package archives.

For the moment, the package uses viper through silicon with the default arguments.

To install it, one must clone the repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone git@github.com:Dspil/viperlanguage-mode.git
#+END_SRC

Then, add the following lines in your init.el.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "<viperlanguage-mode path>")

  (use-package viperlanguage-mode)

  (setq viperlanguage-viper-path "<viper path>")
  (setq viperlanguage-z3-path "<path to Z3>")
  (setq viperlanguage-boogie-path "<path to Boogie>")
#+END_SRC

If you want the verification to happen on save:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'viperlanguage-verify)
#+END_SRC


** Usage

Current keybindings are:

- ~C-c C-c~: Start Viper server
- ~C-c C-v~: Verify this file
- ~C-c C-x~: Stop Viper server
- ~C-c C-b~: Alternate the backend between silicon and carbon
